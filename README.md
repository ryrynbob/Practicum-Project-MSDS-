# Practicum-Project-MSDS-
This project explores the relationship between **sleep duration** and **stress levels** in young adults using R in Google Colab.   The dataset includes two key variables: - Sleep Hours (per night)   - Stress Level (1â€“10 scale)   


The goal is to:
- Understand whether sleep protects against stress.
- Test linear vs. non-linear relationships (splines).
- Apply inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square).
- Build a foundation for larger mental health datasets (screen time, depression, anxiety, productivity).


## ðŸ”¬ Methods (Part 1)
- Data cleaning & descriptive statistics  
- Visualizations: scatterplots, histograms, boxplots  
- Correlation analysis  
- Inferential tests:
  - t-test (short vs. normal sleep)
  - ANOVA (sleep categories)
  - Chi-square (sleep Ã— stress categories)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Part 2)
- Extend to richer datasets (Kaggle, CDC, wearable data).
- Explore screen time, digital habits, and mood in Gen Z.
- Compare micro-patterns (individual) vs. macro-level access to care.

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters
Mental health challenges among young adults are rising. By modeling sleepâ€“stress dynamics, we highlight protective behaviors and set the stage for larger-scale, data-driven insights.
