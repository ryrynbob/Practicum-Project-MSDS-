# Practicum-Project-MSDS-
This project explores the relationship between **sleep duration** and **stress levels** in young adults using R in Google Colab.   The dataset includes two key variables: - Sleep Hours (per night)   - Stress Level (1â€“10 scale)   


The goal is to:
- Understand whether sleep protects against stress.
- Test linear vs. non-linear relationships (splines).
- Apply inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square).
- Build a foundation for larger mental health datasets (screen time, depression, anxiety, productivity).
